GONE FOR GOOD
The Shins

1
Untie me, I've said no vows

The train is getting way too loud
        4
I gotta leave here, my girl
                1
Get on with my lonely life
               5
Just leave the ring on the rail
                       1
For the wheels to nullify

1
Until this turn in my head

Let you stay and you paid no rent
        4                         1
I spent twelve long months on the lam
              5
That's enough sitting on the fence
                         1      5/7
For the fear of breaking dams

6-           1
  I'd find a fatal flaw
       4
In the logic of love
       1         5       6-
And go out of my head
             1
  You love a sinking stone
        4
That'll never elope
       1           5
So get used to the lonesome
      1          5
Girl, you must atone some
      1           5              4               1
Don't leave me no phone number there, la di da


It took me all of a year
To put the poison pill to your ear
But now I stand on honest ground
On honest ground

You wanna fight for this love
But, honey, you cannot wrestle a dove
So, baby, it's clear

You want to jump and dance
But you sat on your hands
And lost your only chance

Go back to your hometown
Get your feet on the ground
And stop floating around

I found a fatal flaw
In the logic of love
And went out of my head
You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope

So get used to used to the lonesome
Girl, you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number there, la di da
