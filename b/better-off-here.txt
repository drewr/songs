BETTER OFF HERE
Glen Phillips


G                    D                G
  I had a lot that I thought I needed but
                       D                   Am
But I'd give it up for you, give you all I got 
     D
It's time that I know it,
Am        D
   Packed up and I'm going 
G               D
Back to where I came from 
    Em             A
The place I got my name from 
       C               D*         Em           Em
Though it won't be the same as it was in those years 
D       C  D          G    D  G D
And Iâ€™m    better off here 

G                                D
  There's nothing wrong with the places I've been in 
G                         D
  Nothing better, they're just a little different 
Am     D                   Am    D
   But somethings missing,    it wasn't really living 
G                      D
  Won't miss the rush,   the complication 
G                    D
I want the hush, the quiet inspiration 
Am         D
   It's my life and I know it 
Am             D
   I'm getting out and I'm going
