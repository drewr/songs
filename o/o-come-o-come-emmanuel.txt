O come, O come, thou Lord of might,
Who to thy tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times didst give the law
In cloud and majesty and awe.

O come, thou rod of Jesse,
Free thine own from from Satan's tyranny.
From depths of hell thy people save
and give them vict'ry o'er the grave.

O come, thou Dayspring from on high
And cheer us by thy drawing nigh.
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight.

O come, thou Key of David,
Come and open wide our heav'nly home.
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery.

O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.

Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel

In cloud and majesty and awe.

Free thine own from from Satan's tyranny.
From depths of hell thy people save
and give them vict'ry o'er the grave.

And death's dark shadows put to flight.

Come and open wide our heav'nly home.
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery.
