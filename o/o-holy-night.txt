O HOLY NIGHT (Bb, c3)

1                 4                  1
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
          1            5              1
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
1                     4             1
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
         3-              7M7           3-
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
  5M7                1
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
    5M7             1
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
6-           3-         2-             6-
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
  1    5     1   4   1     5                 1
O ni - ght divine, O night   when Christ was born;
  5M7   5/4   1/3  4     1     5            1  /////
O ni  - ght divine!    O night,   O night divine!


1                   4              1
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
             1             5         1
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
1                    4            1
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
              3-           7M7    3-
Here came the wisemen from Orient land.
    5sus7   5         1
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger;
   5sus7   5M7    1
In all our trials born to be our friend.
6-           3-           2-             6-
He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger,
  1    5        1    4    1        5     1
Beho - old your King!   Before him lowly bend!
  5M7  5/4      1/3   4    1        5     1
Behold      your King!   Before him lowly bend!


1                     4         1
Truly He taught us to love one another,
           1            5         1
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
1                              4            1
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
           3-         7M7            3-
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
      5M7             1
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
     5M7               1
Let all within us      praise His holy name.
6-            3-         2-               6-
Christ is the Lord! Oh praise His name forever
    1    5       1     4  1    5       1
His po - wer and glo - ry ever more proclaim!
    5M7       1   4    1  5             1
His power and glo - ry e  - ver more proclaim!
